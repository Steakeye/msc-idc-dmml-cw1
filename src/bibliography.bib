	abstract={The article is a continuum of a previous one providing further insights into the structure of neural network (NN). Key concepts of NN including activation function, error function, learning rate and generalized weights are introduced. NN topology can be visualized with generic plot() function by passing a "nn" class object. Generalized weights assist interpretation of NN model with respect to the independent effect of individual input variables. A large variance of generalized weights for a covariate indicates non-linearity of its independent effect. If generalized weights of a covariate are approximately zero, the covariate is considered to have no effect on outcome. Finally, prediction of new observations can be performed using compute() function. Make sure that the feature variables passed to the compute() function are in the same order to that in the training NN.},

	abstract={Many intuitively appealing methods have been suggested for clustering data, however, interpretation of their results has been hindered by the lack of objective criteria. This article proposes several criteria which isolate specific aspects of the performance of a method, such as its retrieval of inherent structure, its sensitivity to resampling and the stability of its results in the light of new data. These criteria depend on a measure of similarity between two different clusterings of the same set of data; the measure essentially considers how each pair of data points is assigned in each clustering.},
